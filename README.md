# Urban Education & Mobility Analytics Dashboard

A data analytics dashboard exploring patterns in urban education, student mobility, teacher onboarding performance, and museum engagement across major U.S. cities.

This project demonstrates how data analysis can support insights into education systems and cultural participation using interactive visualizations and summary metrics.

---

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze urban education and engagement trends across cities and demonstrate core data analytics skills, including:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Trend identification
- Insight generation
- Business-style recommendations

Key analytical objectives include:

- Understanding student enrollment distribution across NYC boroughs
- Analyzing seasonal patterns in student mobility in Chicago
- Evaluating teacher onboarding compliance performance
- Comparing museum attendance between cities

---

## Dashboard Overview

The interactive dashboard highlights several key metrics and trends.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|------|------|
| Total Enrollment | Student enrollment across NYC boroughs |
| Student Movement | Monthly student transfers across schools |
| Teacher Onboarding | Completion rate of teacher compliance processes |
| Museum Attendance | Total museum visitors by city |

---

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals several patterns in the simulated datasets:

- Manhattan shows the highest student enrollment (~7,000 students)
- Student mobility peaks during late spring, suggesting transfer activity before summer
- Teacher onboarding completion is approximately **65%**, with about **35% delayed or escalated**
- Museum attendance in **NYC is roughly 15–18% higher than Chicago**, indicating stronger cultural engagement or tourism volume

---

## Visual Analysis

The dashboard includes several analytical visualizations.

### Museum Attendance Comparison

Compares visitor volume between NYC and Chicago museums.

**Insight:**  
NYC museums receive approximately **18% more visitors** than Chicago.

### Teacher Compliance Completion Analysis

Displays the distribution of teacher onboarding statuses.

Categories include:

- Completed
- Delayed
- Escalated

This helps evaluate onboarding efficiency.

### Enrollment Distribution by Borough

| Borough | Enrollment | % of Total |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Manhattan | 7000 | 23% |
| Brooklyn | 6500 | 21% |
| Queens | 6200 | 20% |

This type of analysis helps identify where resources or capacity may be needed.

### Student Mobility Trend

Monthly movement data highlights seasonal patterns in school transfers.

**Insight:**  
Peak student movement occurs in **late spring**, likely due to school transfers before summer break.

---

## Dataset Overview

This project integrates several simulated datasets to represent real-world analytical scenarios.

Datasets include:

- **NYC Higher Education Enrollment dataset (~30,000 records)**
- **Chicago Student Mobility dataset**
- **Teacher onboarding and compliance records**
- **Museum attendance estimates across cities**

These datasets were aggregated to illustrate trends in enrollment distribution, staffing readiness, mobility patterns, and cultural engagement.

---

## Data Preparation

Several data preparation steps were performed before analysis.

Examples include:

- Removing duplicate enrollment records
- Standardizing borough and city names
- Aggregating monthly student movement totals
- Calculating onboarding completion rates
- Preparing summary metrics for dashboard KPIs

These steps reflect common data cleaning and preparation tasks performed by data analysts.

---

## Interactive Filters

The dashboard includes filters that allow users to explore the data across multiple dimensions.

Available filters include:

- Year
- City
- Borough
- School Type

Example selections:

- Year: 2022 | 2023 | 2024
- City: NYC | Chicago

These filters allow deeper exploration of patterns within the datasets.

---

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several potential actions can be considered:

**Improve teacher onboarding monitoring**  
Earlier compliance tracking may reduce onboarding delays.

**Investigate borough enrollment differences**  
Lower enrollment in Queens compared to Manhattan may warrant further study.

**Prepare schools for peak transfer periods**  
Late spring mobility spikes suggest staffing and resource planning needs.

**Increase museum outreach in Chicago**  
Chicago museums may benefit from stronger marketing or educational partnerships.
